            <p>There's something great about road trips! With friends or family, they're truly a chance to disconnect
                from everything and focus on you destination ahead. I personally love going on road trips with friends
                and family. I look forward to the drive just as much my plans at my actual destination. Check out some
                of the places I've taken a trip to (pre-COVID). For all of them, my starting point was Chicago.</p>

            <section>
                <p>There's simply so much to do and see in NY! I took a road trip there with my family during the summer
                    of 2019, right before the start of my senior year of college. I think I've been to every tourist
                    spot imagineable in the seven days I spent there. From the Statue of Liberty to the Empire State
                    Building to taking the tram to Roosevelt Island. It's safe to say that NY is not driving friendly
                    and I'm glad we figured that out right away so we didn't waste time driving. Trying NY style pizza
                    was from Joe's was fun (even though Chicago tavern-style still takes the win for me!). My favorite
                    part was visiting The MET and getting to see so many Van Gogh and Monet paintings less than two feet
                    away from me. Overall, it was a really great experience.</p>

                <p>Along with my trip to NYC, we also took a detour to DC! I was very pleasantly surprised by DC and I
                    really love that city now. Most of my time was spent exploring the different museums and visiting
                    different monuments. I also had some of the best food there, espcially at a restaurant named Sakina.
                    The city was really great and thanks to this trip, I think I can actually see myself living there
                    one day.</p>

                <p>DC is a great city to explore and I really look forward to being there again! There's a lot of
                    history there and the museums are all free! As a museum lover, there's never-ending exhibitions to
                    explore across all the different museums. Although things closing at 5:00pm is a bit of bummer, the
                    city offers a lot for all interests.</p>

            <section>
                <p>So maybe this one's cheating, but it wasn't a road trip. But still, a truly memorable trip! I took
                    this trip thanks to the Tapia Diversity in Tech conference that students from my school were funded
                    to go to. So basically a free trip to California to not only explore San Diego, but also attend one
                    of the largest tech conferences around. The conference was amazing. It was actually where I
                    discovered U-M's School of Information and the MSI program. I gained a lot of confidence in my
                    professional skills and had an amazing time with my fellow freinds that were on that trip. The food
                    in San Diego is simply some of the best I've ever had. The fresh seafood is unmatched. San Diego was
                    a great place to vist and roam around.</p>

                <p>San Diego was a great place to visit. It's so vibrant and the weather was beautiful during my time
                    there. The food was honestly some of the best I've had and I look forward to experiencing that again
                    one day. I don't think San Diego is really a place I see myself living in, but it is a place I hope
                    to revisit soon post-COVID.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Saint Louis was a spur of the moment I took with my friends to cheer on our school basketball team in
                    Saint Louis. The Ramblers were poised to win Arch Madness and possbily secure another ticket to the
                    Big Dance and we wanted to be there for it. Unfortunaly we lost right before the finals, but that
                    didn't mean we didn't take advantage of our time there. The city had so many unexpected surprises to
                    offer, especially the food. I got to try the original Saint Louis Bread Company (aka Panera) and a
                    bunch of other restuarants that were simply amazing. St. Louis has a lot of halal options easily
                    available, which I also appreciated. I went to the see the arch and also got a chance to check out a
                    local dinner that had pretty great milkshakes.</p>

                <p>Saint Louis was a fun few days. It was definitely enjoybale mainly becuase I was with a great group
                    of people and you could really feel the school spirit at the tournament. The drive there and back
                    also wasn't too bad since it was only a few hours compared to the other cities.</p>
